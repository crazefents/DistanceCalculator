# DistanceCalculator
Small app for Android that uses GPS/Network location to measure distances and save some of the locations you want.

I have created this app to learn more about Android development and it's location service, resulting in a simple, functional, but not so usefull app. I'm currently focusing on different projects, so this will have few changes over time.

<br>Feel free to suggest new changes, make commits and learn from the code as i did.
<br>If you need any help, send me an e-mail and i'll be happy to help.

(My coding may not be really good, but i'm working on it.)
