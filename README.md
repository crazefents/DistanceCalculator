# DistanceCalculator
Small app for Android that uses GPS/Network location to measure distances and save some of the locations you want. 

I have created this app to learn more about Android development and it's location service.
<br>Feel free to suggest new changes, make commits and learn from the code as i did.
<br>If you need any help, send me an e-mail and i'll be happy to help.

(My coding may not be really good, but i'm working on it.)
